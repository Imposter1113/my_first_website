            <h1>The Battle Cats played by Seungmin</h1>
    
            <p>hello? I am Seungmin Hong who likes to play games.</p>
            <p>Today, I will tell you how to easily break The Battle Cats.</p>
            <img src= "The Battle Cats.jpg"/>
            <p>If you are starting The Battle Cats for the first time, you will see this screen when you install The Battle Cats and run it.</p>
            <img src= "Tutorial.jpg"/>
            <p>In this case, you can upgrade the money while doing what you are told to do, and press the launch OK button when the line is pushed.</p>
            <p>Please upgrade evenly on the power-up screen and do the Cats Draw, Rare Draw, and Event Draw, and don't go if something pops up.</p>
            <p>If you have any difficulties, you can watch the strategy video on YouTube.</p>
            <p>And basically, all the treasures in all stages (except Legend Stage and Cats Dojo) must be of the highest quality. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to break Nyanko.</p>
            <p>And it's easier if you combine a strong nyanko with the enemy character on the stage.</p>
            <p>If you Want to See links Under this paragraph use translation</p>
            <p>thank you.</p>
